## Framework Projects

We all collect useful utility functions and classes over the years and months we are developing.  This repository contains some of the code I've abstracted out of projects to be used over and over again to solve common problems.  This is also common code that I use in my sample projects for technical talks.  By having it organized into a sepaate repository like this, I can have each sample application point at this repository and not have to copy the code into each individual app.

If you see something up here that you find useful, feel free to borrow it.

The repository currently has three projects

- **DavidBerry.Framework** - A collection of common utilities and classes
- **DavidBerry.Framework.Spatial** - Code related to spatial data like latitude/longitude points, calclating distances and geocoding
- **DavidBerry.Framework.ApiUtil** - Code related to common elements of building ASP.NET Core APIs
